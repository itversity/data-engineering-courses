    "## Difference Between Unique and Primary Key Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us compare and contrast `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` constraints.\n",
    "* There can be only one `PRIMARY KEY` in a table where as there can be any number of `UNIQUE` constraints.\n",
    "* `UNIQUE` constraint columns can have null values unless `NOT NULL` is also enforced. In case of `PRIMARY KEY`, both uniqueness as well as not null are strictly enforced. In other words a primary key column cannot be null where as unique column can be null.\n",
    "* `FOREIGN KEY` from a child table can be defined against `PRIMARY KEY` column or `UNIQUE` column.\n",
    "* Typically `PRIMARY KEY` columns are surrogate keys which are supported by sequence.\n",
    "* `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` can be composite. It means there can be more than one column to define `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraint.\n",
    "* Both `PRIMARY KEY` as well as `UNIQUE` constraints are supported by indexes to avoid full table scan to enforce uniqueness."
