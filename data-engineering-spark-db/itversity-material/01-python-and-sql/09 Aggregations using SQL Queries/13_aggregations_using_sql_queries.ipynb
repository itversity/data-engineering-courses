    "Let us understand how to aggregate the data.\n",
    "* We can perform global aggregations as well as aggregations by key. Here are most commonly used aggregate functions - `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `count`, etc.\n",
    "* Global Aggregations\n",
    "  * Get total number of orders.\n",
    "  * Get revenue for a given order id.\n",
    "  * Get number of records with `order_status` either `COMPLETE` or `CLOSED`.\n",
    "* Aggregations by key - using `GROUP BY`\n",
    "  * Get number of orders by date or status.\n",
    "  * Get revenue for each `order_id`.\n",
    "  * Get daily product revenue (using order date and product id as keys).\n",
    "* We can also use `HAVING` clause to apply filtering on top of aggregated data.\n",
    "  * Get daily product revenue where revenue is greater than $500 (using order date and product id as keys).\n",
    "* Rules while using `GROUP BY`.\n",
    "  * We can have the columns which are specified as part of `GROUP BY` in `SELECT` clause.\n",
    "  * On top of those, we can have derived columns using aggregate functions.\n",
    "  * We cannot have any other columns that are not used as part of `GROUP BY` or derived column using non aggregate functions.\n",
    "  * We will not be able to use aggregate functions or aliases used in the select clause as part of the where clause.\n",
    "  * If we want to filter based on aggregated results, then we can leverage `HAVING` on top of `GROUP BY` (specifying `WHERE` is not an option)\n",
    "* Typical query execution - `FROM` -> `WHERE` -> `GROUP BY` -> `SELECT`"
