# Scenario 6: Table Partitioning and Partition Pruning

## 6.1 What Is Table Partitioning?

Table partitioning divides large tables into smaller, manageable physical segments while maintaining a single logical view. Each partition contains a subset of data based on defined criteria (partition key).

## 6.2 Benefits of Partitioning

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Partition pruning eliminates irrelevant data segments
   - Reduced I/O through targeted partition access
   - Parallel query execution possibilities

2. **Improved Manageability**
   - Easier maintenance of large tables
   - Simplified backup and recovery
   - Efficient data archival

3. **Enhanced Scalability**
   - Better handling of large datasets
   - Improved query performance
   - Efficient resource utilization

## 6.3 Partitioning Strategies

### Range Partitioning
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id BIGINT,
    user_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(12,2),
    created_at DATE,
    status VARCHAR(50)
) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);

-- Partitions
CREATE PARTITION transactions_2024 
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
CREATE PARTITION transactions_2025 
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2026-01-01');
```

### List Partitioning
```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id INT,
    region VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(12,2)
) PARTITION BY LIST (region);

-- Partitions
CREATE PARTITION sales_north FOR VALUES IN ('North');
CREATE PARTITION sales_south FOR VALUES IN ('South');
```

### Hash Partitioning
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE
) PARTITION BY HASH (customer_id) 
  PARTITIONS 4;
```

## 6.4 Partition Pruning Example

```sql
-- Query that benefits from partition pruning
SELECT * 
FROM transactions 
WHERE created_at >= '2025-01-01' 
  AND created_at < '2025-02-01';

-- Only scans the 2025 partition instead of the entire table
```

## 6.5 Platform-Specific Implementation

### PostgreSQL
- Declarative partitioning (PostgreSQL 10+)
- Range, list, and hash methods
- Partition pruning at planning and execution

### MySQL
- Range, list, hash, and key partitioning
- Maximum 1024 partitions per table
- Automatic partition pruning

### SQL Server
- Partition functions and schemes
- Up to 15,000 partitions
- Aligned indexes for better performance

### Oracle
- Advanced partitioning features
- Range, list, hash, composite
- Partition-wise joins

## 6.6 Best Practices

1. **Partition Key Selection**
   - Choose frequently filtered columns
   - Ensure sufficient cardinality
   - Consider query patterns

2. **Partition Size Management**
   - Avoid too large or too small partitions
   - Plan for data growth
   - Monitor partition usage

3. **Indexing Strategy**
   - Consider local vs. global indexes
   - Align indexes with partition keys
   - Monitor index usage

4. **Maintenance Procedures**
   - Regular partition management
   - Archival strategies
   - Statistics updates

## 6.7 Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-Partitioning**
   - Too many small partitions
   - Increased management overhead
   - Complex maintenance

2. **Poor Partition Key Choice**
   - Insufficient pruning
   - Uneven data distribution
   - Suboptimal performance

3. **Inadequate Monitoring**
   - Missing partition usage patterns
   - Delayed maintenance
   - Performance degradation

## 6.8 Summary

Table partitioning is a powerful technique for managing large-scale databases. Success depends on:
- Choosing appropriate partitioning strategies
- Careful partition key selection
- Regular maintenance and monitoring
- Understanding platform-specific features

When implemented correctly, partitioning provides:
- Improved query performance
- Better data management
- Enhanced scalability
- Efficient maintenance operations
