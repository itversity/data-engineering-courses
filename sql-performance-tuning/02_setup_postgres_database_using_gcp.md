# Setting Up a PostgreSQL Database Using GCP Cloud SQL

Learn how to set up, secure, and optimize a fully managed PostgreSQL instance on Google Cloud SQL—covering everything from project setup to performance tuning.

## 1. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Overview

### What Is GCP?
- **Google’s Public Cloud Platform**: Provides a range of services for compute, storage, networking, databases, and machine learning—all backed by Google’s robust infrastructure.
- **Managed Services**: With Cloud SQL, you get a managed relational database platform that handles updates, patches, and failover automatically.
- **Focus on Innovation**: GCP allows developers to concentrate on their applications, offloading tasks like hardware provisioning and server management.

## 2. Why PostgreSQL?

### Key Features
- **Standards Compliance**: Follows SQL standards closely, ensuring portability.
- **Complex Query Support**: Handles window functions, table partitioning, subqueries, and advanced joins.
- **Extensibility**: Integrate custom extensions like PostGIS for geospatial data.
- **Performance**: Efficient for OLTP (transaction-heavy) and analytics workloads with advanced indexing.
- **Vibrant Community**: Large, active community plus extensive documentation.

## 3. Setting Up PostgreSQL on Cloud SQL

### 3.1 Project Setup
1. Navigate to the GCP Console: [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable Cloud SQL Admin API:
   ```sh
   gcloud auth login  # Log into GCP
   gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   gcloud services enable sqladmin.googleapis.com
   ```

### 3.2 Instance Creation
```sh
gcloud sql instances create perf-demo-instance \
    --database-version=POSTGRES_15 \
    --cpu=1 \
    --memory=3840MB \
    --region=us-central1 \
    --storage-size=10GB \
    --storage-type=SSD \
    --storage-auto-increase

gcloud sql users set-password postgres \
    --instance=perf-demo-instance \
    --password='perfdemo123'

# You can also stop the instance after creation when you don't need to use it
# It will save the instance cost
gcloud sql instances patch perf-demo-instance \
    --activation-policy=NEVER

# To start the instance again
gcloud sql instances patch perf-demo-instance \
    --activation-policy=ALWAYS
```

### 3.3 Network Configuration
```sh
gcloud sql instances patch perf-demo-instance \
    --assign-ip \
    --authorized-networks=0.0.0.0/0 \
    --no-require-ssl
```
**Security Note**: `--authorized-networks=0.0.0.0/0` opens the instance to all IP addresses. For real-world deployments, specify only trusted IP ranges or use private connections.

### 3.4 Connection Methods
```sh
gcloud sql connect perf-demo-instance --user=postgres

psql --host=<PUBLIC_IP> \
    --port=5432 \
    --username=postgres \
    --dbname=postgres
```

## 4. Performance Tuning Setup

### 4.1 Basic Configuration
```sh
SHOW max_connections;
SHOW shared_buffers;
SHOW work_mem;
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '1GB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET work_mem = '16MB';
```

### 4.2 Monitoring Setup
```sh
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
SELECT query, calls, total_time, rows FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC;
```

### 4.3 Index Management
```sh
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sales_date ON sales(sale_date);
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan FROM pg_stat_user_indexes ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### 4.4 Additional Tables
If you have scripts for creating/loading data:
```sh
\i setup/01_create_tables.sql
\i setup/02_load_data.sql
\i setup/03_verify_setup.sql
```
This is a convenient way to bulk-load schemas and data into your instance.

## 5. Best Practices

### 5.1 Security
- Enable SSL connections for encrypted data in transit
- Use strong passwords and role-based access control
- Restrict IP ranges instead of using `0.0.0.0/0` in production
- Keep up with security patches

### 5.2 Backup Strategy
- Enable automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- Define retention periods and monitor backup storage usage

### 5.3 Monitoring
```sh
SELECT pid, query, state FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state != 'idle';
SELECT relname, seq_scan, idx_scan FROM pg_stat_user_tables;
```

## 6. Common Operations

### 6.1 Database Creation
```sh
CREATE DATABASE performance_tuning;
\c performance_tuning
```

### 6.2 User Management
```sh
CREATE USER app_user WITH PASSWORD 'secure_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE performance_tuning TO app_user;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO app_user;
```

### 6.3 Maintenance
```sh
VACUUM ANALYZE;
REINDEX DATABASE performance_tuning;
```

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Connection Problems**: Check firewall rules, verify IP allowlisting, confirm SSL settings if required.
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor CPU/RAM usage, examine query plans with `EXPLAIN / EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- **Storage Concerns**: Track disk usage, monitor Write-Ahead Logs (WAL), and keep an eye on backup overhead.

## Summary

### Key Setup Points:
- **Create GCP Project & Enable APIs**
- **Configure a PostgreSQL Instance with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage**
- **Network & Security**: Choose between public IP or private IP, enable SSL, and manage IP allowlisting
- **Performance Basics**: Tune memory settings, enable `pg_stat_statements` for monitoring, and create essential indexes
- **Maintenance**: Regularly review logs, vacuum, and analyze for stable performance

### Next Steps:
- Implement Replication if high availability is required
- Automate Backups and define a recovery strategy
- Deep-Dive Performance tuning with indexing strategies and table partitioning
- Monitor & Profile for bottlenecks and scalability improvements
