# Scenario 10: Parallelism and Concurrency in Data Processing

## Introduction

Efficient processing of large datasets often requires parallelism and concurrency to optimize performance and ensure scalability. This guide explores various approaches to parallel processing and concurrent operations in database systems.

## Native Database Parallelism

### Parallel Query Execution
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT o.order_id, 
       SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) AS total_order_value
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY o.order_id;
```
**Benefits:**
- Automatic parallel execution
- Optimized for large joins
- Hardware-aware scaling

## Application-Level Parallelism

### Multi-Threaded Data Loading Example
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def load_data_parallel(data_chunks, max_workers=4):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        futures = []
        for chunk in data_chunks:
            future = executor.submit(process_chunk, chunk)
            futures.append(future)
        
        for future in as_completed(futures):
            future.result()
```

### Performance Comparison
```python
# Single-threaded approach
start_time = time.time()
for chunk in data_chunks:
    process_chunk(chunk)
print(f"Single-threaded time: {time.time() - start_time}")

# Multi-threaded approach
start_time = time.time()
load_data_parallel(data_chunks)
print(f"Multi-threaded time: {time.time() - start_time}")
```

## Processing Layer Selection

### Database Layer Processing
```sql
-- Efficient for set-based operations
SELECT product_id, 
       SUM(quantity) as total_sold,
       AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING SUM(quantity) > 1000;
```

### Application Layer Processing
```python
# Complex business logic
def process_sales_data(sales):
    for sale in sales:
        # Custom validation
        if validate_sale(sale):
            # External API enrichment
            enriched_data = enrich_with_external_data(sale)
            # Complex transformation
            transformed_data = apply_business_rules(enriched_data)
            save_to_database(transformed_data)
```

## Concurrency Configuration

### Connection Management
```sql
-- Check current settings
SHOW max_connections;
SHOW shared_buffers;

-- Monitor active connections
SELECT count(*) 
FROM pg_stat_activity 
WHERE state = 'active';
```

### Transaction Isolation Levels
```sql
-- Set isolation level
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;

-- Check current level
SHOW transaction_isolation;
```

### Lock Management
```sql
-- Monitor locks
SELECT relation::regclass, mode, granted
FROM pg_locks
WHERE NOT granted;
```

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### 1. Parallel Processing
```sql
-- Enable parallel workers
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
SET max_parallel_workers = 8;

-- Force parallel scan
SET min_parallel_table_scan_size = '8MB';
```

### 2. Batch Processing
```python
def process_in_batches(data, batch_size=1000):
    for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size):
        batch = data[i:i + batch_size]
        process_batch(batch)
```

### 3. Connection Pooling
```python
from psycopg2.pool import ThreadedConnectionPool

pool = ThreadedConnectionPool(
    minconn=5,
    maxconn=20,
    dsn="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db"
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - Use native database parallelism for set-based operations
   - Implement application-level parallelism for complex logic
   - Balance parallel workers with available resources

2. **Concurrency Management**
   - Monitor and adjust connection pools
   - Choose appropriate isolation levels
   - Handle deadlocks and lock timeouts

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - Control batch sizes
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Balance CPU utilization

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track query execution times
   - Monitor resource utilization
   - Identify bottlenecks

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Too many parallel workers
   - Excessive connections
   - Memory overutilization

2. **Concurrency Issues**
   - Deadlocks
   - Lock contention
   - Transaction timeouts

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Inappropriate batch sizes
   - Poor isolation level choices
   - Inefficient resource allocation

## Summary

Effective parallelism and concurrency require:
1. Balanced resource utilization
2. Appropriate processing layer selection
3. Proper concurrency configuration
4. Regular monitoring and optimization

Key Takeaways:
- Choose between native and DIY parallelism based on use case
- Configure appropriate concurrency settings
- Monitor and optimize resource usage
- Balance performance with system stability
